Major changes in 0.10.0
=======================

   possible.

Major changes in 0.9.99
=======================

 * Fix git source bundling on older git version
 * New property: appdata-license lets you easily modify the appstream license field
 * New source type "extra-data" which makes it easier to use extra-data apps
 * We now automatically compress debuginfo unless the no-debuginfo-compression
   option is specified.
 * Appstream files called .metainfo.xml are now recognized.
 * New prepare-platform-commands property, similar to cleanup-platform-commands,
   but run before importing all the changes from the SDK.
 * We now apply all the deletions that happened in the SDK on the base when creating
   the platform.

Major changes in 0.9.98
=======================

 * build cache hits are now faster
 * git sources have a new property "tag" which works the same as "branch", but
   improves readability when referencing a git tag.
 * flatpak-builder --run now passes  --with-appdir which is useful when
   testing uninstalled builds.
 * When bundling git repos in .Sources we now make a shallow clone which uses
   a lot less space.
 * .Locale extensions now always set the new locale-subset property
 * locale-subset is supported in the add-extension property
 * build-options now also supports make-args and make-install args, which
   allows per-arch make flags.
