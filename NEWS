Major changes in 0.9.98
=======================

 * build cache hits are now faster
 * git sources have a new property "tag" which works the same as "branch", but
   improves readability when referencing a git tag.
 * flatpak-builder --run now passes  --with-appdir which is useful when
   testing uninstalled builds.
 * When bundling git repos in .Sources we now make a shallow clone which uses
   a lot less space.
 * .Locale extensions now always set the new locale-subset property
 * locale-subset is supported in the add-extension property
 * build-options now also supports make-args and make-install args, which
   allows per-arch make flags.
